            We are the screen in the darkness to those seeking aid. We are the energy drink in 
            the fridge when their strength wavers. We are the controller and systems who refuse 
            to let you down. We are the loading screens that grant you moments of respite and bathroom 
            breaks. We are GameOverFlow, ally to all those who battle with controllers and keyboards. 
            Enemy to all those who oppose them. GameOverFlow will have the answers you seek even in 
            the darkest of your gaming moments.
