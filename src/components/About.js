            <p>We are the screen in the darkness to those seeking aid. 
            We are the energy drink in the fridge when their strength wavers. 
            We are the controller and systems who refuse to let you down. 
            We are the loading screens that grant you moments of respite and 
            bathroom breaks. We are GameOverFlow, ally to all those who battle 
            with controllers and keyboards. Enemy to all those who oppose them. 
            GameOverFlow will have the answers you seek even in the darkest of your 
            gaming moments. </p>
